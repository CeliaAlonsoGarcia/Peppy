        <p class="greeting">Hello Alanna,</p>

        <p class="text">
          I am Celia Alonso, a professional marketer with excellent project
          management skills and a passion for improving people's lives. I am
          writing to express my keen interest in joining the Peppy team.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          For over a year, I have closely followed your journey, inspired by
          your fearless approach to breaking health-related taboos and
          empowering individuals through information and support. Having
          personally experienced the challenges of PCOS, I deeply understand the
          importance of your mission. As I share your values and passion, I am
          excited about the possibility of contributing my skills, experience,
          and dedication to your team.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          I specialise in both business-to-business (B2B) and
          business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing. In my current role as a
          Marketing and Collaborations Manager, I oversee marketing campaign
          planning and execution, event coordination and product launches. In
          this fast environment, I also manage SEO strategies and email
          marketing.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          I have a proven track record in project management, with experience in
          improving sustainable practices, coordinating website development, and
          managing events. These experiences have taught me how to juggle
          multiple projects while meeting deadlines.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          I have a passion for making a positive impact on people's lives. I
          have volunteered with organisations across Asia addressing
          homelessness and education, where I initiated a successful fundraising
          campaign to provide essential water filters.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          I am an active and positive person who likes to get involved, I have
          great initiative and the ability to easily build rapport. I am a
          results-driven person with an entrepreneurial spirit and I thrive in a
          busy environment where I can continuously develop and learn. As I
          truly share your passion for helping people take back control of their
          health for a happier life, I am excited about the opportunity to bring
          my energy and skills to this team.
        </p>

        <p class="greeting">Thank you in advance for your time.</p>

        <p class="greeting">Best regards,</p>
        <p class="greeting">Celia</p>

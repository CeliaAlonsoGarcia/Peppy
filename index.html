        <p class="greeting">Hi Beam Team,</p>

        <p class="text">
          My name is Celia Alonso, and I am a natural people person with
          excellent communication skills and experience delivering growth
          through partnerships. I was excited to see that Beam is hiring a
          Client Success Executive as I have been following Beam's inspiring
          work for a while and I am extremely passionate about the power of
          technology as a force for good. As a dedicated advocate for social
          justice, I have a genuine desire to make a positive impact in people's
          lives.

      <div class="panel">
       
         
            <h3>Passionate About Helping Dissadvantaged Communities</h3>
            <p class="start">
            Last year, I started volunteering at the North London Action for Homeless gardening project. 
            This project provides a safe space where people can experience a sense of belonging. 
            
            Before that, after university, I spent six months volunteering at different charities in Asia that tackled homelessness and lack of education in deprived areas. 
            During that time, I also developed a fundraising campaign to buy and deliver water filters to various charities
            </p>
        

        
            <h3>I Believe In Tech As A Force For Good</h3>
            <p class="start">
          I'm a firm believer that using tech in the right way can dramatically improve people's lives. Beam is a great example of that, 
          in the last few months I've been following on LinkedIn how the lives of people like Karina, John or Anna  
          were changed thanks to it. I've been inspired by this and in my free time I recently started to learn HTML, CSS & JS.

      <h2 class="accordion">Why would I be the perfect Client Success Executive?</h2>
      <div class="panel">
       
         <h3>I am Great at Spotting New Opportunities & Building Long-lasting Partnerships  </h3>
            <p class="start">
           As the Marketing and Collaborations Manager at Fill Refill, a sustainability driven start-up, 
           I enjoy identifying partnerships opportunities and creating long-term relationships with other brands, organisations, accounts and charities. 
           I regularly organise stands at tradeshows and events where we pitch to potential new clients & partners. 
            </p>
          

               <h3>
I have Exceptional Organisational Skills and Problem-Solving Ability </h3>
            <p class="start">
            A great part of my previous role as a Closed Loop Coordinator involved finding out what sustainable practices could be improved, 
            coming up with solutions and managing the projects to implement the changes. 
            This together with my experience organising stands at tradeshows and events 
            helped me develop my organisation skills and taught me how to react in a calm and fast way to unexpected events. 
 
</p>
        <h3> I am a Target Driven Person </h3>
            <p class="start"> I thrive in a target-driven work environment where I passionately believe in the company's goal. In my current job, last year, 
              I increased the amount of partnerships by 150% creating 20 new partnerships.</p>

               <h3>And.. </h3>
        <p class="start"> I am an active and positive person that likes to get involved, I have great initiative and the ability to easily build rapport. 
          I am a very confident speaker that thrives in a busy environment where I can develop and learn. 
          As I truly share your passion to use tech as a force for good and desire to improve people's lives, I know I would commit all my energy to this role. </p>
       

          
        
        <p class="nostart">Thank you for your consideration,</br>
